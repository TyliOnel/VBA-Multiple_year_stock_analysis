# VBA Multiple Year Stock Analysis
Conducted an examination of stock data spanning from 2018 to 2020 across multiple companies. For a quick summary, 2019 stood out with the highest stock price percentage increase at 190.03%, while the stock price percentage decreases remained consistent over the three years. The stock volume more than doubled from 2018 to 2019, experiencing a slight decline in 2020 but still significantly higher than the volume in 2018. From this data we can conclude, that stocks in 2018 performed comparatively worse overall, with the lowest increases and volume peaks within the examined timeframe.


With help from the class TA, a tutor and a class-study group I was able to finish the VBA challenge.
